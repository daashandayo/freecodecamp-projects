        <blockquote>
          <p>Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest... he took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and as they say, he was definitely a man who
            could hold an audience in the palm of his hand.</p>
