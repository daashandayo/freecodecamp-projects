                <p>
                    Cal Newport is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Georgetown University. In addition to
                    researching cutting-edge technology, he also writes about the impact of these innovations on
                    society. Newport is the author of five books. His most recent, Deep Work, argues that the ability
                    to focus is becoming increasingly valuable in a modern work culture increasingly hobbled by
                    distracting technologies.
